# CRAN-task-view-games
Task Views proposal for games. 
Still very much a work in progress. 

# _Scope:_ 
*Include one or two paragraphs about the scope of the task view, outlining the inclusion and exclusion criteria
  as well as relevant sections within the topic.*
  
This proposal contains a list of R packages that are games or are about games, including game theory.
Board games, video games and puzzles are included.
  
# _Packages:_ 
*Include a _tentative list_ of packages for the task view. This should encompass the "core" packages
  and a collection of relevant packages, ideally grouped by sections within the topic. It is not important, yet,
  that the list of sections or packages is already exhaustive.*
  
Will need to use each package to determine it's correct category.
Will add each CRAN package with 'game' in it here, then go through them and remove any that don't fit. 

Games marked with \* need checking by installing and using the package.

# _Overlap:_
*Comment on potential overlap with already existing task views as well as with task views that might be
  created (or split off) in the future.*

- Could overlap with [TeachingStatistics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TeachingStatistics.html), BetaBit is an example.
  
# _Maintainers:_
*The proposal should be made by the person willing to act as the principal maintainer for the task view.
  Furthermore, task views should have teams of additional 1-5 co-maintainers and possible candidates for these can be listed
  as well in the proposal.*
  
- Rick Tankard as principal maintainer. 
- Matt Dray as co-maintainer
